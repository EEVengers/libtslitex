# Litex Windows Driver and Library

This repo contains Visual Studio projects for building a driver, library and test application for the [LitePCIe LiteX core](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litepcie).

The library is intended to have a compatible API with the liblitepcie found in the [LitePCIe user software](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litepcie/tree/master/litepcie/software/user/liblitepcie) to facilitate cross platform applications.
